# wdi-project-4-client
General Assembly WDI24 Final Project Client

This project was made with Ruby on Rails for the back-end and Angular.JS in the back-end.

The idea was to make an app for sharing data about favourite travel places.

Challenges and wins:

- challenges for me were to implement Angular.JS, and the Rails authentication.
- wins: I am happy with the overall styling (font and colour)

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby-on-Rails, Angular.js, SASS.
